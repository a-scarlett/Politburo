# Politburo
(Problem from the Game Theory course by N.S. Kalinin, which I coded)

Let there be n deputies at the congress. Each of them has political weight a_i. After each meeting, it is decided by voting to expel someone from the party or to end the congress.

Moreover, each deputy is guided by the following priorities:

1) Stay in the party

2) Eliminate as many other participants as possible

3) Among the remaining ones, have the best position in the weight gradation

Question: Who will remain in the party after the congress ends?
